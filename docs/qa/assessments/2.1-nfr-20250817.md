# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-08-17
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting on webhook endpoint
- Performance: PASS - Meets API response requirements with caching
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and circuit breaker pattern
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage at 0%, target is 80%

## Critical Issues

1. **No rate limiting on webhook endpoint** (Security)
   - Risk: Webhook endpoint vulnerable to DoS attacks
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware specifically for /webhooks/acuity endpoint

2. **Test coverage 0%** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: No validation that implementation works correctly
   - Fix: Implement all planned test suites (unit and integration)

## Quick Wins

- Add webhook rate limiting: ~2 hours
- Implement critical security tests: ~4 hours
- Add basic unit tests: ~6 hours

## Detailed NFR Analysis

### Security - CONCERNS
**Evidence Found:**
- ✓ HTTP Basic Auth implemented for Acuity API
- ✓ X-Acuity-Signature validation for webhooks
- ✓ Environment-based credential management
- ✓ Authorization checks on specialist endpoints

**Gaps:**
- ✗ No rate limiting on webhook endpoint (DoS vulnerability)
- ✗ No tests for signature validation logic
- ✗ Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Performance - PASS
**Evidence Found:**
- ✓ Redis caching with 5-min TTL for availability
- ✓ Rate limiting logic for Acuity API (10 req/sec)
- ✓ Timeout configuration on API calls
- ✓ Cache-first strategy reduces API load

**Meets Requirements:**
- API response times expected <200ms with caching
- Rate limits prevent API exhaustion
- Proper indexing on database queries

### Reliability - PASS
**Evidence Found:**
- ✓ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✓ Circuit breaker pattern for API downtime
- ✓ Webhook event storage for audit trail
- ✓ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✓ Graceful degradation with cached data

**Strengths:**
- Handles Acuity API downtime gracefully
- Webhook processing queue prevents data loss
- Proper logging for debugging

### Maintainability - CONCERNS
**Evidence Found:**
- ✓ Well-structured code following repository pattern
- ✓ TypeScript types for all Acuity responses
- ✓ Clear separation of concerns
- ✓ Consistent coding patterns

**Critical Gap:**
- ✗ 0% test coverage (no tests implemented)
- ✗ Missing API documentation
- ✗ No integration test framework setup

## Recommendations Priority

1. **Immediate (Before Production)**
   - Implement webhook rate limiting
   - Add security tests for signature validation
   - Create basic unit tests for critical paths

2. **High Priority**
   - Complete test suite implementation
   - Add API documentation
   - Implement security headers

3. **Medium Priority**
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Create developer documentation
   - Set up integration test environment

## Risk Score

Quality Score: 60/100
- -10 for Security CONCERNS
- -10 for Maintainability CONCERNS
- Full points for Performance and Reliability PASS
