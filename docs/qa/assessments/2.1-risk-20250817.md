Date: 2025-08-17
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 11
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 26/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Webhook Signature Validation Bypass
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Webhook endpoints are common attack vectors; without proper signature validation, attackers can inject malicious webhook payloads
**Impact**: High - Could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized bookings, or system compromise through crafted webhook payloads
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust X-Acuity-Signature header validation using HMAC-SHA256
- Store webhook secret securely in environment variables
- Reject requests with missing or invalid signatures immediately
- Log all webhook validation failures for security monitoring
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with invalid signatures, replay attacks, timing attacks

### 2. DATA-001: Patient Data Exposure via API
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple API endpoints handling sensitive booking and specialist data; any authorization flaw exposes PHI
**Impact**: High - HIPAA violations, regulatory fines, loss of patient trust, potential lawsuits
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict authorization checks on all specialist and availability endpoints
- Apply data minimization principles - only return necessary fields
- Add field-level permissions for sensitive data
- Implement audit logging for all data access
**Testing Focus**: Authorization bypass attempts, data leakage tests, API fuzzing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Testing Suite**:
  - Webhook signature validation with invalid/missing signatures
  - Authorization bypass attempts on all API endpoints
  - API fuzzing to detect data leakage
  - Penetration testing of authentication flows
- **Data Protection Tests**:
  - PHI exposure verification across all endpoints
  - Field-level permission enforcement
  - Audit log completeness validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Integration Resilience Tests**:
  - Acuity API downtime simulation
  - Rate limit exhaustion scenarios
  - Webhook processing failure recovery
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Load testing near rate limits
  - Concurrent availability requests
  - Cache performance under load

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Operational Tests**:
  - Redis failover scenarios
  - Webhook deduplication logic
  - Calendar sync consistency checks
- **Standard Tests**:
  - Unit tests for all services
  - Integration tests for happy paths
  - Error handling verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Webhook signature validation implementation (SEC-001)
- Authorization on all sensitive endpoints (DATA-001)
- Acuity API error handling with user messaging (TECH-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Rate limiting with monitoring alerts (PERF-001)
- Webhook processing with retry logic (OPS-001)
- Redis caching with fallback to direct API calls (TECH-002)

### Accepted Risks
- None recommended - all identified risks should be addressed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**:
  - Failed webhook signature validations
  - Authorization failures per endpoint
  - API key usage patterns
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - API rate limit utilization (threshold: 80%)
  - Cache hit/miss ratios
  - Response times for availability queries
- **Operational Metrics**:
  - Webhook processing success rate
  - Acuity API availability
  - Redis connection pool health
- **Data Metrics**:
  - Calendar sync discrepancies
  - Booking data consistency checks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new Acuity API integrations
- Modifying authentication/authorization logic
- Changing caching strategies
- Experiencing security incidents
- Acuity API changes or deprecations
- HIPAA compliance requirements update
