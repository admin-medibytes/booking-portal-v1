summary: |
  Excellent S3 integration implementation with all critical security issues resolved.
  CORS properly restricted and role-based access cleverly implemented via booking 
  service integration. HIPAA-compliant with strong encryption, audit logging, and 
  clean architecture. Ready for production deployment. Recommended improvements are
  non-blocking and can be scheduled for future iterations.
