## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified - PRD is ready for architecture phase

**HIGH:**
- No competitive analysis of existing IME booking platforms
- Limited documentation of user research methodology
- Technical risks (Acuity dependency, HIPAA compliance complexity) not explicitly flagged for architect attention

**MEDIUM:**
- Baseline metrics for current process could be more detailed
- Data retention policies mentioned but not specified
- Migration approach for existing bookings not addressed

**LOW:**
- Diagrams for user flows would enhance clarity
- Glossary for medical-legal terms would help new team members

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Analysis:**
- The MVP is appropriately scoped with 4 focused epics
- Clear separation between MVP and post-MVP features
- Each epic delivers tangible value
- 6-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with the defined scope

**Features Appropriately Deferred:**
- Automated notifications (manual status checking is sufficient for MVP)
- Native booking system (Acuity dependency acceptable initially)
- Advanced analytics and dashboards
- Payment processing

**Essential Features Included:**
- Invite-only authentication with 2FA
- Core booking workflow with Acuity integration
- Secure document management with portal-proxy
- Admin impersonation for phone support continuity

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:**
- Technology stack clearly defined (Next.js 15, Hono.js, Better Auth)
- HIPAA compliance requirements explicit
- Performance expectations quantified
- Integration points identified

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- Acuity API dependency is a single point of failure
- HIPAA compliance on bootstrap budget needs careful planning
- Portal-proxied downloads could become performance bottleneck

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
- Optimal caching strategy for Acuity data
- Scalable approach for portal-proxied downloads
- Audit log storage and rotation strategy
- Better Auth organization plugin complexity with teams

## Recommendations

1. **Before Architecture Phase:**
   - Document known Acuity API limitations and fallback strategies
   - Create high-level data flow diagram for document access
   - Specify audit log retention period (e.g., 7 years for legal compliance)

2. **During Architecture Phase:**
   - Design for eventual Acuity replacement
   - Plan for horizontal scaling of portal-proxy service
   - Define disaster recovery approach for S3 documents

3. **For Product Success:**
   - Plan user onboarding strategy for invite-only model
   - Define success metrics for first 30/60/90 days post-launch
   - Create feedback collection mechanism for early users

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. While there are some areas that could be enhanced (competitive analysis, user research documentation), none of these gaps block the architecture phase. The technical requirements are clear, the scope is appropriate for MVP, and the epic structure provides a logical implementation path.
