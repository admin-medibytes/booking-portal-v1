## Background Context
The Medical Examination Booking Platform addresses a critical inefficiency in Australia's personal injury legal system. Law firms are required by regulation to work through intermediary services when booking Independent Medical Examinations with specialists. Currently, this process relies on manual phone coordination, creating 15-20 minute booking times, limited visibility, and compliance risks. With 50+ active referrers and ~90 bookings monthly, the current system wastes approximately 27 hours of staff time on coordination alone. This platform digitizes the entire IME workflow, providing a secure, role-based portal that serves as the central hub for all stakeholders while maintaining strict compliance with medical privacy regulations.
