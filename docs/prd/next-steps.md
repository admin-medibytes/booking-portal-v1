# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Please help create the UI/UX design for the Medical Examination Booking Platform using this PRD. Focus on the professional medical-legal aesthetic with #a2826c as the primary accent color, ensuring WCAG AA compliance, and designing the key screens: login, dashboard with calendar/list views, booking creation wizard, and admin impersonation interface. The design should prioritize efficiency for busy legal professionals while maintaining trust and compliance standards.

## Architect Prompt
Please create the technical architecture for the Medical Examination Booking Platform based on this PRD. Use Next.js 15 with App Router, integrate Hono.js via router.ts, implement Better Auth with all specified plugins (admin, organization with teams, 2FA, phone, email OTP), design the PostgreSQL schema with Drizzle ORM, and ensure HIPAA-compliant document storage using AWS S3 with portal-proxied downloads. Focus on creating a secure, scalable architecture that supports the invite-only authentication model and comprehensive audit logging.
