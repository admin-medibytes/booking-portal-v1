4. **Implement core booking flow** as the first feature
5. **Add document management** once bookings work
6. **Deploy to AWS** using the CDK infrastructure

## Developer Handoff

For the development team:
1. Review the complete architecture document
2. Set up local development environment
3. Run Better Auth CLI to generate auth tables
4. Create initial database migrations from schema
5. Begin with Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure
6. Use the defined tech stack versions exactly as specified
7. Follow the coding standards and error handling patterns

## Architect Prompt for Frontend Focus

If additional frontend-specific architecture is needed:

"Please create detailed frontend architecture documentation for the Medical Examination Booking Platform, expanding on the frontend sections of this fullstack architecture. Focus on component composition patterns, advanced state management scenarios, performance optimization strategies, and detailed responsive design breakpoints. Include specific implementation patterns for the booking wizard, calendar view, and document upload components."
