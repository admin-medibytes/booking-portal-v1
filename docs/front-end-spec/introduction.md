# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Medical Examination Booking Platform's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Power Referrer:** High-volume personal injury lawyers who create 10+ bookings weekly and need maximum efficiency with keyboard shortcuts and bulk operations

**Occasional Referrer:** Lawyers who book IMEs infrequently (1-2 per month) and need clear guidance and intuitive workflows

**Admin Coordinator:** Internal staff managing phone-based bookings who need quick search and impersonation capabilities while multitasking

**Time-Conscious Specialist:** Medical professionals conducting multiple examinations daily who need streamlined access to relevant information

### Usability Goals

- Efficiency of use: Experienced referrers complete bookings in under 2 minutes
- Ease of learning: New users successfully create first booking without training
- Error prevention: Clear validation prevents booking conflicts and missing information
- Memorability: Returning users navigate confidently after weeks of inactivity
- Satisfaction: Professional interface builds trust in the platform's security and reliability

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over complexity** - Every interface element has a clear purpose with no decorative distractions
2. **Status visibility** - Users always know where bookings stand in the examination workflow
3. **Efficiency through consistency** - Repeated patterns reduce cognitive load across all interfaces
4. **Respect user time** - Minimize clicks and page loads for common tasks
5. **Trust through transparency** - Security and compliance measures visible without being intrusive
