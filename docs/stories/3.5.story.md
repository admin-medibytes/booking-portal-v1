# Story 3.5: Role-Based Document Access

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** documents to respect role-based permissions,  
**so that** users only see documents they're authorized to access.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Referrers see all documents for their own bookings
2. Specialists see documents only for assigned bookings
3. Organization owners/managers see documents for their organization
4. Team leads see documents for their team members' bookings
5. Admins see all documents when impersonating referrers
6. Document visibility rules clearly documented in help text
7. Unauthorized access attempts return 403 with appropriate message
8. Permission checks performed on both list and download operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.4 implemented document-permissions.service.ts with category-based permissions
- Permission checks are already integrated at service layer for categories
- Document service uses portal-proxy pattern for secure downloads
- Audit logging is implemented for all document operations
- Frontend already has permission-based UI rendering for categories

### Existing Authorization Architecture
**User Role Model**:
- Global roles: `admin` | `user` (in userRoleEnum)
- Member roles: `owner` | `manager` | `team_lead` | `referrer` | `specialist` (in memberRoleEnum)
- Users linked to organizations via members table with specific roles
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-roles]

**Authorization Middleware Available**:
- `authMiddleware` - Basic authentication check
- `requireAuth` - Require authenticated user
- `requireRole(role)` - Check specific role
- `requireAdmin` - Admin-only access
- `requireOrgPermission` - Organization-based permissions
- `checkImpersonation` - Impersonation handling
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#middleware-guards]

### Data Models and Relationships
**Document Access Chain**:
```
documents → bookings → organizations/referrers/specialists
         ↓
    bookingId
         ↓
   booking.organizationId → members table (for org access)
   booking.referrerId → users table (for referrer access)
   booking.specialistId → specialists table (for specialist access)
```

**Key Relationships**:
- Documents belong to bookings via `bookingId`
- Bookings belong to organizations via `organizationId`
- Bookings reference referrer users via `referrerId`
- Bookings reference specialists via `specialistId`
- Users have organization roles via members table
- Team members linked via teamMembers table
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#relationships]

### File Locations
**Services**:
- `/src/server/services/document.service.ts` - Main document service
- `/src/server/services/document-permissions.service.ts` - Existing permissions service
- `/src/server/services/booking.service.ts` - For booking relationships
- `/src/server/services/auth.service.ts` - For user context

**Middleware**:
- `/src/server/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - Authentication/authorization middleware

**Routes**:
- `/src/server/routes/documents.routes.ts` - Document endpoints

**Repositories**:
- `/src/server/repositories/document.repository.ts` - Document data access
- `/src/server/repositories/booking.repository.ts` - Booking data access

**Frontend**:
- `/src/components/bookings/documents-section.tsx` - Document UI
- `/src/hooks/use-documents.ts` - Document fetching hook
- `/src/lib/api-client.ts` - API error handling

### Security Requirements
- NEVER expose direct S3 URLs - always use portal-proxy pattern
- All document access must be audited via audit.service.ts
- Permission checks must occur at service layer, not just middleware
- 403 errors must include descriptive messages for debugging
- Admin impersonation must be properly tracked in audit logs
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]

### Permission Check Logic
For each document access request, verify:

1. **Referrers**: `booking.referrerId === user.id`
2. **Specialists**: `booking.specialistId === user.specialistId`
3. **Organization Owners/Managers**: 
   - User has `owner` or `manager` role in `booking.organizationId`
   - Check via members table join
4. **Team Leads**: 
   - User has `team_lead` role
   - Booking referrer is in user's team (via teamMembers)
5. **Admins**: 
   - Check impersonation context
   - If impersonating, use impersonated user's permissions
   - If not impersonating, deny access (admins don't have blanket access)

### Technical Constraints
- Use ArkType for all input validation
- Maintain existing portal-proxy download pattern
- All permission denials must be audit logged
- Use existing Better Auth session for user context
- Leverage Drizzle ORM for efficient joined queries
- Follow existing error response format from error-handling-strategy.md
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing Requirements
Follow patterns from architecture/testing-strategy.md:
- Unit tests: 
  - `/tests/unit/services/document.service.test.ts` - Extended access tests
  - New test file for role-based access logic
- Integration tests: 
  - `/tests/integration/api/documents-rbac.test.ts` - Role-based access tests
  - Test each role with valid/invalid booking scenarios
  - Test impersonation scenarios
- Component tests: 
  - `/tests/unit/components/documents-section.test.tsx` - Permission UI tests
  - Test error state rendering for 403 responses

## Testing

Test implementation follows patterns from architecture/testing-strategy.md

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid role-based access control architecture with comprehensive permission checks at multiple layers. The code follows separation of concerns with dedicated service methods for access validation. Key strengths include:

- Well-structured permission hierarchy with clear role definitions
- Proper impersonation support for admin users
- Comprehensive audit logging for all document operations
- Defensive security practices (no direct S3 URL exposure)
- Good error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - code quality is satisfactory for the requirements.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Following ArkType validation, service layer patterns, proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper separation of concerns across services, routes, and repositories
- Testing Strategy: N/A Test implementation deferred per user guidance
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria are implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Test coverage deferred per user guidance
- [ ] Consider extracting role-based access checks into a dedicated authorization service
- [ ] Add rate limiting for document listing endpoints (currently only on upload/download)
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed permission checks
- [ ] Add request context tracing for better debugging of access denials

### Security Review

Security implementation is robust with multiple defense layers:
- ✓ Permission checks at service layer (not just middleware)
- ✓ No direct S3 URL exposure (portal-proxy pattern)
- ✓ Comprehensive audit logging with IP/user-agent tracking
- ✓ Proper session validation and expiry checks
- ✓ Rate limiting on sensitive operations

One minor concern: Error messages in verifyAccess() catch block use console.error - consider structured logging.

### Performance Considerations

- Multiple database queries per access check could impact performance at scale
- Consider caching user role/membership data with appropriate TTL
- Team membership checks could benefit from indexed queries

### Files Modified During Review

None - code quality meets requirements without modification.

### Gate Status
