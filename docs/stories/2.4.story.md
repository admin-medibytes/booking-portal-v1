# Story 2.4: List View with Advanced Filtering

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to view bookings in a sortable list with the same filtering as calendar view,  
**so that** I can efficiently find and manage specific bookings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tabular list displays key booking information: date, time, examinee, specialist, status
2. Same three filters as calendar: status (Active/Closed), specialist multi-select, examinee search
3. Sortable columns for date, specialist name, and status
4. Pagination handles large booking sets efficiently (20 per page)
5. Each row has "View Details" button for navigation to detail page
6. Booking status badges use consistent colors across the application
7. Export functionality allows downloading filtered results as CSV
8. List performance remains fast with 1000+ bookings

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- BookingFilters component already created with status toggle, specialist multi-select, and search
- useBookings hook established with TanStack Query patterns and 30-second cache
- URL-based state management pattern proven successful
- Booking uses examDate, patientFirstName, patientLastName fields
- Status color coding and badges already implemented
- Mobile-first responsive design approach established

### Data Models
**Booking Model Fields for List Display**:
```typescript
interface Booking {
  id: string;
  examDate: Date; // Main date field
  patientFirstName: string;
  patientLastName: string;
  specialistId: string;
  status: 'active' | 'closed' | 'archived';
  currentProgress: 'scheduled' | 'rescheduled' | 'cancelled' | 'no_show' | 
                  'generating_report' | 'report_generated' | 'payment_received';
  appointmentType: 'in_person' | 'telehealth';
  // Related data
  specialist: {
    name: string;
    specialty: string;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**Booking List Endpoint with Pagination**:
- `GET /api/bookings` - Supports pagination and filtering
- Query parameters:
  - `page`: integer (default: 1)
  - `limit`: integer (default: 20)
  - `status`: 'active' | 'closed' - Filter by booking status
  - `specialistIds`: string[] - Filter by specialist IDs
  - `search`: string - Search by examinee name
  - `startDate`: Date - Start of date range
  - `endDate`: Date - End of date range

**Pagination Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  data: Booking[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    totalPages: number;
  }
}
```

### Component Specifications
**TanStack Table Implementation**:
- Version 8.21.3 with built-in sorting, filtering, pagination
- Integrates with TanStack Query for server state
- Column definitions should use proper TypeScript types
- Sorting state managed by table, synced to URL
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework]

**State Management Pattern**:
```typescript
// Extend existing query keys for pagination
export const queryKeys = {
  all: ['bookings'] as const,
  lists: () => [...queryKeys.all, 'list'] as const,
  list: (filters: BookingFilters & PaginationParams) => 
    [...queryKeys.lists(), filters] as const,
};

// Update useBookings hook for pagination
export function useBookings(
  filters: BookingFilters, 
  pagination: PaginationParams
) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: queryKeys.list({ ...filters, ...pagination }),
    queryFn: () => bookingsService.list(filters, pagination),
    staleTime: 30 * 1000, // 30 seconds
  });
}
```

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/components/bookings/booking-list-table.tsx` - New table component
- `/src/components/bookings/booking-filters.tsx` - Existing, to be reused
- `/src/hooks/use-bookings.ts` - Update to support pagination
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/bookings/page.tsx` - Update for view toggle
- `/src/components/ui/pagination.tsx` - May need to add Shadcn component
- `/src/lib/csv-export.ts` - New utility for CSV generation
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use TanStack Table 8.21.3 for table implementation
- Reuse existing BookingFilters component without modification
- Maintain 30-second cache time for consistency
- CSV export should handle Unicode characters properly
- Follow established mobile-first responsive patterns
- Status badges must match calendar view exactly
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### CSV Export Guidelines
**Client-side Export (Current Page)**:
- Use a library like `papaparse` or custom implementation
- Include columns: Date, Time, Examinee, Specialist, Status, Type
- Format dates consistently (ISO 8601 or locale-specific)
- Handle special characters and commas in data

**Server-side Export (All Filtered Results)**:
- Create endpoint: `GET /api/bookings/export`
- Accept same filter parameters as list endpoint
- Stream response for memory efficiency
- Set proper headers: `Content-Type: text/csv`
- Include BOM for Excel compatibility

### Performance Optimization
- TanStack Table handles virtualization if needed
- Use React.memo for expensive cell renderers
- Implement proper key props for efficient re-renders
- Consider pagination limits (max 50-100 per page)
- Leverage existing TanStack Query cache

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Gate Decision:** CONCERNS  

### Summary
List view implementation demonstrates strong technical execution with proper use of TanStack Table, performance optimizations, and integration with existing filters. However, CSV export functionality was omitted and no test coverage exists, creating moderate quality risks.

### Requirements Coverage
✅ **AC1: Tabular list displays key booking information** - All required fields displayed correctly  
✅ **AC2: Same three filters as calendar view** - Successful reuse of BookingFilters component  
✅ **AC3: Sortable columns** - Date, specialist, and status columns properly sortable  
✅ **AC4: Pagination (20 per page)** - Implemented with 10/20/50 options and URL state  
✅ **AC5: View Details button** - Each row has navigation to detail page  
✅ **AC6: Consistent status badges** - Matches calendar view styling exactly  
❌ **AC7: CSV export functionality** - Not implemented (noted as skipped per request)  
✅ **AC8: Performance with 1000+ bookings** - Optimized with React.memo and server pagination  

### Technical Quality Assessment
- **Code Organization:** PASS - Clean component structure, proper separation of concerns
- **Type Safety:** PASS - Full TypeScript coverage with proper types
- **Performance:** PASS - React.memo optimization, efficient re-renders, server-side pagination
- **State Management:** PASS - Proper URL synchronization, view preference persistence
- **Error Handling:** PASS - Loading and error states properly handled
- **Testing:** FAIL - No test coverage implemented

### Risk Analysis
1. **Missing CSV Export (HIGH)** - Users cannot export filtered data for analysis
2. **No Test Coverage (HIGH)** - Complex table interactions untested, regression risk
3. **Limited Accessibility (MEDIUM)** - Missing ARIA labels for screen readers
4. **Pagination Edge Cases (LOW)** - Handled well with URL state management

### Positive Observations
- Excellent TanStack Table v8.21.3 integration with TypeScript
- Smart performance optimizations throughout
- Successful reuse of BookingFilters without modification
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper mobile responsiveness
- Consistent UI patterns with existing components

### Recommendations
**Critical:**
- Implement CSV export to complete AC7
- Add comprehensive test suite for table component
- Improve accessibility with ARIA labels

**Important:**
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Consider virtual scrolling for extreme datasets
- Implement keyboard navigation

### Technical Debt Incurred
- CSV export functionality deferred
- No unit or integration tests
- Limited accessibility implementation
- No loading skeleton states

### Verdict Rationale
CONCERNS verdict issued due to missing CSV export functionality (AC7) and complete absence of test coverage. While implementation quality is high with 7/8 acceptance criteria passing, the missing export feature and lack of tests create production readiness concerns that should be addressed in follow-up work.
