   - Configure OTP length and expiration with `otpLength` and `expiresIn` options
   - Enable sign-up with phone using `signUpOnVerification` option
4. **2FA Plugin**: TOTP authenticator app support
   - Set issuer to `env.APP_NAME` [Source: better-auth/plugin-2fa.md#issuer]
   - Configure TOTP options: 30-second period, 6 digits [Source: better-auth/plugin-2fa.md#totp-options]
   - Set up backup codes with 10 codes of 8 characters each

- specialist: Can view assigned bookings - permissions: ["booking.read"]
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-roles, better-auth/plugin-organization.md#roles]

### API Endpoints
Better Auth provides built-in endpoints that need to be mounted to Hono:

**Core Authentication Routes** (handled by Better Auth):
- POST /api/auth/sign-in/email - Email/password login
- POST /api/auth/sign-out - Session termination  
- POST /api/auth/sign-up/email - User registration
- GET /api/auth/session - Current session info

**Plugin-Specific Routes** (automatically added by plugins):
- Admin: `/api/auth/admin/*` - User management endpoints
- Organization: `/api/auth/organization/*` - Org/team management
- 2FA: `/api/auth/two-factor/*` - 2FA enrollment/verification
- Phone: `/api/auth/phone-number/*` - Phone verification
- Email OTP: `/api/auth/email-otp/*` - Email OTP flows

**Hono Route Handler**:
```typescript
// Mount Better Auth to handle all /api/auth/* routes
app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/*", (c) => {
  return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});
```
[Source: better-auth/integration-hono.md#mount-the-handler]

### Security Considerations

**Session Security**:
- Use httpOnly, secure cookies in production via `advanced.useSecureCookies: true` [Source: better-auth/concept-cookies.md#secure-cookies]
- CSRF protection is built-in with Better Auth
- Configure cookie prefix with `advanced.cookiePrefix` option [Source: better-auth/concept-cookies.md#cookie-prefix]
- Configure session expiration with `session.expiresIn` (default 7 days)
- Enable session caching with `session.cookieCache` for performance
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#security]

**Role-Based Access Control**:
- Implement middleware using `auth.api.getSession` for authentication checks [Source: better-auth/integration-hono.md#middleware]
- Use `hasPermission` API for organization permission checks [Source: better-auth/plugin-organization.md#has-permission]
- Organization-based data isolation via `activeOrganizationId` in session
- Audit all authentication events (integrate with audit service)
- Track impersonation with `impersonatedBy` field in session [Source: better-auth/plugin-admin.md#schema]
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#multi-tenant-architecture]

**Environment Variables**:
Already configured in /src/lib/env.ts:
- BETTER_AUTH_SECRET: Random 32+ character secret (used as `secret` in config)
- BETTER_AUTH_URL: Base URL for auth callbacks (used as `baseURL` in config)
- AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS: Comma-separated list of trusted origins
- SESSION_TIMEOUT: Session expiration in seconds
- REDIS_URL: Optional Redis connection for session storage
- AWS_SES_REGION: For email sending via SES
- SES_FROM_EMAIL: Sender email for OTP/invitations
- Feature flags for phone verification and admin impersonation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#environment-management]

### Database Integration
Better Auth will use existing tables created in Story 1.2:
- users: Core user data (with role, phoneNumber, phoneNumberVerified, twoFactorEnabled fields)
- accounts: OAuth provider accounts
- sessions: Active user sessions (with activeOrganizationId, impersonatedBy fields)
- organizations: Multi-tenant organizations
- member: Organization members (replaces organizationMembers)
- invitation: Organization invitations
- teams: Sub-organization teams (if teams enabled)
- teamMembers: User-team relationships
- verifications: Email/phone verifications
- twoFactor: 2FA secrets and backup codes
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#better-auth-tables]

### Implementation Examples

**Auth Configuration Example**:
```typescript
// /src/lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { admin, organization, twoFactor, phoneNumber, emailOTP } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { db } from "@/server/db";
import { env } from "@/lib/env";
import * as schema from "@/server/db/schema/auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "pg",
    schema: {
      user: schema.user,
      session: schema.session,
      account: schema.account,
      verification: schema.verification,
      organization: schema.organization,
      member: schema.member,
      invitation: schema.invitation,
      twoFactor: schema.twoFactor,
    },
  }),
  baseURL: env.BETTER_AUTH_URL,
  secret: env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  trustedOrigins: env.AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS?.split(","),
  
  session: {
    expiresIn: Number(env.SESSION_TIMEOUT) || 604800,
    updateAge: 86400,
    cookieCache: { enabled: true, maxAge: 300 },
  },
  
  advanced: {
    useSecureCookies: env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    cookiePrefix: env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "__Secure-" : "",
  },
  
  plugins: [
    admin({ defaultRole: "user", adminRole: "admin" }),
    organization({
      allowUserToCreateOrganization: false,
      enableTeams: true,
      roles: { /* custom roles */ },
      sendInvitationEmail: async (data) => { /* implement */ },
    }),
    twoFactor({ issuer: env.APP_NAME }),
    phoneNumber({ sendOTP: async ({ phoneNumber, code }) => { /* implement */ } }),
    emailOTP({ sendVerificationOTP: async ({ email, otp }) => { /* implement */ } }),
  ],
});
```

**Middleware Example**:
```typescript
// /src/server/middleware/auth.middleware.ts
import { createMiddleware } from "hono/factory";
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

export const authMiddleware = createMiddleware(async (c, next) => {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: c.req.raw.headers });
  c.set("auth", { user: session?.user, session: session?.session });
  await next();
});

export const requireAuth = createMiddleware(async (c, next) => {
  const authContext = c.get("auth");
  if (!authContext?.user) {
    throw new HTTPException(401, { message: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  await next();
});
```
