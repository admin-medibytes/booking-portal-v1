# Story 2.2: Booking Creation Workflow

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** referrer,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Acuity API integration completed with proper authentication and rate limiting
- Specialist endpoints implemented: GET /api/specialists, GET /api/specialists/{id}/availability
- Redis caching configured with 5-minute TTL for availability data
- Booking service already has syncWithAcuity method for creating appointments
- ArkType validation schemas established for API endpoints

### Data Models
**Booking Model Fields Required**:
```typescript
interface Booking {
  specialistId: string;
  examineeName: string;
  examineePhone: string;
  examineeEmail: string | null;
  appointmentType: 'in_person' | 'telehealth';
  appointmentDateTime: Date;
  notes: string | null;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#booking]

**Specialist Model for Display**:
```typescript
interface Specialist {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  specialty: string;
  location: string | null; // null for telehealth-only
  isActive: boolean;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#specialist]

### API Specifications
**Key Endpoints for Booking Creation**:
- `GET /api/specialists` - Returns list of active specialists
- `GET /api/specialists/{id}/availability?startDate={date}&endDate={date}` - Returns available time slots
- `POST /api/bookings` - Creates new booking with Acuity sync

**Booking Creation Request**:
```typescript
{
  specialistId: string;
  appointmentDateTime: Date | string;
  examineeName: string;
  examineePhone: string;
  examineeEmail?: string;
  appointmentType: 'in_person' | 'telehealth';
  notes?: string;
}
```
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-patterns]

### Component Specifications
**Form State Management**:
- Use TanStack Form 1.19.1 for form state and validation
- Integrate ArkType 2.1.20 for validation schemas
- No global client state needed - use local component state
- URL state via Next.js router for step tracking only (no PII)
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]

**UI Component Structure**:
```text
app/components/
├── bookings/
│   ├── SpecialistSelect.tsx
│   ├── TimeSlotPicker.tsx
│   ├── ExamineeForm.tsx
│   └── BookingConfirmation.tsx
└── forms/
    └── MultiStepForm.tsx
```
[Source: architecture/components.md#component-organization]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/app/(app)/bookings/new/page.tsx` - Multi-step booking form page
- `/src/app/components/bookings/SpecialistSelect.tsx` - Specialist selection component
- `/src/app/components/bookings/TimeSlotPicker.tsx` - Time slot picker component
- `/src/app/components/bookings/ExamineeForm.tsx` - Examinee information form
- `/src/app/components/bookings/BookingConfirmation.tsx` - Success confirmation
- `/src/app/components/forms/MultiStepForm.tsx` - Reusable multi-step form wrapper
- `/src/hooks/use-create-booking.ts` - Custom hook for booking creation
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#frontend-structure]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use ArkType for ALL validation - no Zod or other libraries
- Forms must use TanStack Form for state management
- Server state managed with TanStack Query (no Redux/Zustand)
- All dates must handle timezone conversion properly
- Use Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain <3 second load time for booking form
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Core Workflow Implementation
**Booking Creation Flow**:
1. User navigates to /bookings/new
2. Fetch and display active specialists
3. User selects specialist and preferred date
4. Fetch availability from API with Redis caching
5. Display time slots in user's timezone
6. User selects time and enters examinee details
7. Submit booking to create Acuity appointment
8. Show confirmation with booking details
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#booking-creation-workflow]

### Timezone Handling
- Use date-fns 4.1.0 with date-fns-tz for timezone operations
- Always display times in user's local timezone
- Store all times in UTC in database
- Pass timezone in API requests for proper conversion

## Testing

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `/tests/unit/components/bookings/`
  - `specialist-select.test.tsx`
  - `time-slot-picker.test.tsx`
  - `examinee-form.test.tsx`
- Hook tests: `/tests/unit/hooks/use-create-booking.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `/tests/e2e/booking-flow.spec.ts`

**Testing Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with React Testing Library
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-stack]

**Testing Standards**:
- Mock API responses in component tests
- Test timezone conversion logic thoroughly
- Verify form validation with invalid inputs
- Test error states and loading states
- Test XSS protection with malicious inputs
- Test concurrent booking scenarios
- E2E test must cover complete happy path and conflict resolution
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

**Component Test Example**:
```typescript
// tests/unit/components/bookings/time-slot-picker.test.tsx
describe('TimeSlotPicker', () => {
  it('displays time slots in user timezone', () => {
    // Test timezone conversion
  });
  
  it('handles loading and error states', () => {
    // Test API states
  });
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good architectural decisions with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive input sanitization, and database transaction handling. However, a critical gap exists: **zero test coverage** despite all test tasks being marked as completed. The code quality is high, but without tests, maintainability and reliability cannot be guaranteed.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent security implementation with DOMPurify sanitization
- ✅ Proper database transactions with optimistic locking
- ✅ Clean component architecture following project standards
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No test files exist (0% coverage)
- ❌ CSP headers not implemented (marked as infrastructure level)
- ❌ Alternative slot suggestions feature incomplete

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed due to the absence of tests. Refactoring without test coverage poses unacceptable risk to functionality.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ArkType validation, TanStack Form usage, proper file structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized, follows unified structure
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **FAIL** - No tests exist despite story marking them complete
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC7 partially met (no alternative slot suggestions)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create all missing test files listed in story
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement unit tests for all booking components
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create E2E test for complete booking flow
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test concurrent booking scenarios for race conditions
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Validate XSS protection with security tests
- [ ] Implement CSP headers at application level
- [ ] Complete alternative time slot suggestion feature
- [ ] Add performance tests for <3min completion requirement

### Security Review

**Positive:**
- DOMPurify implementation for XSS protection
- Rate limiting on booking creation endpoint
- Input validation with ArkType schemas
- Backend sanitization of all inputs

**Concerns:**
- No security tests to validate XSS protection
- CSP headers missing (defense in depth)
- No penetration testing for form inputs

### Performance Considerations

**Identified Issues:**
- No load tests for availability API response times
- No performance validation for 3-minute completion requirement
- Redis caching implemented but not tested under load

### Files Modified During Review

None - refactoring avoided due to lack of test coverage.

### Requirements Traceability

**AC Coverage Mapping:**
- AC1 (Multi-step form): ✓ Implemented, ✗ No tests
- AC2 (Real-time availability): ✓ Implemented, ✗ No tests  
- AC3 (Timezone display): ✓ Implemented, ✗ No tests
- AC4 (Examinee form): ✓ Implemented, ✗ No tests
- AC5 (<3min completion): ✗ No performance tests
- AC6 (Success confirmation): ✓ Implemented, ✗ No tests
- AC7 (Error recovery): ✓ Partial (no alt slots), ✗ No tests

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → Critical test coverage gap
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.2-risk-20250817-v2.md

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - **Do not mark as Done until tests are created**

The implementation quality is high, but marking test tasks as completed without creating the actual test files is a critical process failure. All test files must be created and passing before this story can be considered complete.
