# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to initialize the Next.js 15 project with Hono.js integration,  
**so that** we have a working foundation with API routing and deployment-ready structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 15 project initialized with App Router and TypeScript configuration
2. Hono.js installed and router.ts configured to handle API routes through Next.js
3. Docker configuration created for containerized deployment
4. Environment variable structure established for configuration management
5. Basic health check endpoint accessible at /api/health returning system status
6. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for Next.js projects
7. Development server runs successfully with hot reload working

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Framework**: Vitest 2.0.0 for both frontend and backend tests
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-22-23]

**Test Organization**:
- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/` directory
- Backend API tests in `tests/unit/services/` or `tests/integration/api/`
- Test file naming: `{filename}.test.ts` or `{filename}.test.tsx`
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Testing Requirements for this story**:
- Create `tests/integration/api/health.test.ts` for health endpoint
- Use Vitest with proper test setup configuration
- Follow the testing patterns shown in testing-strategy.md

### Project Structure
The project must follow the structure defined in unified-project-structure.md:
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Key directories to create (all within the `/src` directory):
- `src/app/` - Next.js app directory with api routes
- `src/server/` - Backend code with routes, services, repositories, middleware
- `src/lib/` - Shared utilities
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/hooks/` - React hooks
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/styles/` - Global styles
- `tests/` - Test files organized by type (at root level)
- `infrastructure/` - IaC definitions (at root level)

### Technology Stack Requirements
**Package Manager**: pnpm 9.5.0 (MUST use pnpm, not npm or yarn)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-25]

**Core Dependencies to Install**:
- Next.js 15.0.0 (Frontend Framework)
- TypeScript 5.3.3 (Language)
- Hono 4.5.0 (Backend Framework)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 (CSS Framework)
- @t3-oss/env-nextjs 0.11.0 (Environment Variables)
- date-fns 3.6.0 (Date Handling)
- Vitest 2.0.0 (Testing)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Hono.js Integration Pattern
API routes are handled through Next.js route handlers that delegate to Hono:
- Main handler at `src/app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts`
- Hono app setup in `src/server/app.ts`
- Route definitions in `src/server/routes/` directory
- Middleware in `src/server/middleware/` directory
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#controller-route-organization]

### Environment Variable Configuration
Must use @t3-oss/env-nextjs for type-safe environment variables with runtime validation
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-34]
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#line-7]

### Docker Configuration Notes
Docker setup must include:
- PostgreSQL 15.4 for database
- Redis 7.2 for caching
- Proper volume mounts for development
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#line-17,19]

### Coding Standards
- Never access environment variables directly - use validated env object
- Follow TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Use kebab-case for API routes
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is well-structured and follows modern best practices. The developer has successfully set up a Next.js 15 project with Hono.js integration and proper TypeScript configuration. The code demonstrates good architectural decisions with clear separation of concerns. The use of ArkType for environment validation (as specified in technical preferences) is correctly implemented with @t3-oss/env-nextjs v0.13.8 which supports ArkType presets.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The implementation is clean and follows the specified patterns correctly.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode enabled, proper file organization
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows the unified project structure with /src directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Vitest configured with integration tests for health endpoint
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation requirements have been met. No additional improvements needed.

### Security Review

Environment variables are properly validated using @t3-oss/env-nextjs with ArkType validators. Secrets are excluded from version control through comprehensive .gitignore configuration.

### Performance Considerations

- Docker multi-stage build optimizes image size
- Next.js standalone output configured for efficient production builds
- Appropriate use of Alpine Linux images for smaller container footprint

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done
