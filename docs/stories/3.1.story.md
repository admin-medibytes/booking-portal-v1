### Data Models
**Document Model**:
```typescript
interface Document {
  id: string;                // cuid2 - Unique identifier
  bookingId: string;         // Associated booking
  uploadedById: string;      // User who uploaded (from Better Auth)
  s3Key: string;            // S3 object key
  fileName: string;         // Original filename
  fileSize: number;         // Size in bytes
  mimeType: string;         // File MIME type
  category: 'consent_form' | 'brief' | 'report' | 'dictation' | 'other';
  createdAt: Date;          // Upload timestamp
}
```

### AWS Configuration
**S3 Bucket Settings**:
- Region: ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)
- Encryption: AES-256 (SSE-S3) server-side encryption
- Access: All public access blocked
- Versioning: Enabled for document history
- Logging: CloudTrail data events enabled
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#aws-s3-api]

**IAM Role Permissions**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

### API Specifications
**Upload Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/documents`
- Multipart form data with file and metadata
- Returns document ID and metadata
- Supports files up to 100MB

**Download Endpoint**:
- `GET /api/documents/:id`
- Streams file through application proxy
- Never exposes S3 URLs to client
- Includes proper Content-Type headers

**Delete Endpoint**:
- `DELETE /api/documents/:id`
- Soft-delete in database
- Permanent deletion from S3
- Audit log entry created

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/lib/s3.ts` - AWS S3 client configuration
- `/src/server/services/document.service.ts` - Document business logic
- `/src/server/repositories/document.repository.ts` - Database operations
- `/src/server/routes/documents.routes.ts` - API endpoints
- `/src/types/document.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `/infrastructure/lib/s3-stack.ts` - CDK infrastructure code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure]

### Technical Constraints
- Never expose S3 URLs directly to clients
- All access must go through application proxy
- Pre-signed URLs max 5-minute expiration
- Support multipart upload for large files
- Audit log all document operations
- Implement rate limiting on endpoints
- Use AWS SDK v3 for better performance
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-requirements]

### Security Implementation
**Portal Proxy Pattern**:
```typescript
// Never return S3 URLs to client
// Always stream through application
async downloadDocument(id: string, userId: string) {
  // 1. Verify user has access to document
  // 2. Generate pre-signed URL (5 min expiry)
  // 3. Stream S3 object to response
  // 4. Log access in audit trail
}
```

**Encryption Headers**:
```typescript
const uploadParams = {
  Bucket: bucketName,
  Key: s3Key,
  Body: fileBuffer,
  ServerSideEncryption: 'AES256',
  ContentType: mimeType,
  Metadata: {
    uploadedBy: userId,
    bookingId: bookingId
  }
};
```

### Infrastructure as Code
**S3 Bucket CDK**:
```typescript
const documentBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'DocumentBucket', {
  bucketName: 'medibytes-documents-prod',
  encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
  versioned: true,
  blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
  lifecycleRules: [{
    id: 'delete-old-versions',
    noncurrentVersionExpiration: cdk.Duration.days(90)
  }]
});
```

### 2. Security Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Server-side encryption (AES-256) enforced on all uploads
- ✅ Portal proxy pattern implemented - S3 URLs never exposed to clients
- ✅ Pre-signed URLs limited to 5-minute expiry
- ✅ All public access blocked at bucket level
- ✅ CloudTrail audit logging for all S3 operations
- ✅ Database encryption for sensitive fields (s3Key, fileName)
- ✅ Rate limiting on upload endpoint (50/hour per user)
- ✅ **FIXED**: CORS configuration now restricted to application URLs (S3Stack.ts:46-49)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Role-based access control implemented via booking service integration

**Previously Critical Findings (NOW RESOLVED):**
- ✅ **CORS Configuration** - Fixed to use environment-specific URLs instead of wildcard
- ✅ **Access Control** - Now leverages booking service permissions for proper role-based access

### 3. HIPAA Compliance Analysis

**Compliant Elements:**
- ✅ Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Encryption in transit (HTTPS enforced by SDK)
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging via CloudTrail
- ✅ Access controls with authentication and role-based authorization
- ✅ Data retention policies configured

**Minor Gaps (Non-Critical):**
- ⚠️ Missing Business Associate Agreement (BAA) validation in code comments
- ⚠️ No documented disaster recovery plan for S3 data
- ⚠️ Audit log retention only 30 days (consider extending for compliance)

### 4. Code Quality Assessment

**Positive Aspects:**
- Clean separation of concerns (service/repository/routes)
- Proper error handling with cleanup on failure
- TypeScript types well-defined
- Multipart upload for large files (>5MB)
- Comprehensive validation using arktype
- Smart access control reusing existing booking permissions

**Minor Issues (Non-Critical):**
- ⚠️ Inconsistent error messages expose internal details
- ⚠️ Missing input sanitization for file names (only basic replacement)
- ⚠️ No file type validation beyond MIME type
- ⚠️ Hard-coded part size for multipart uploads (not configurable)

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis

**Test Implementation:**
- ✅ Integration test script covers happy path
- ✅ Tests verify upload, download, metadata, deletion
- ✅ Encryption verification included

**Missing Test Scenarios (Recommended):**
- ❌ No unit tests for individual components
- ❌ No error scenario testing
- ❌ No multipart upload testing
- ❌ No rate limit testing
- ❌ No access control testing
- ❌ No load/performance testing

### 6. Performance & Scalability

**Strengths:**
- Multipart upload for files >5MB
- Streaming downloads prevent memory issues
- AWS SDK v3 for better performance

**Future Considerations:**
- No caching strategy for frequently accessed documents
- No CDN configuration for document delivery
- Single bucket design may hit AWS rate limits at scale

### 7. Risk Assessment Matrix (Updated)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Status |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| PHI data breach | Low | Critical | ✅ Encryption implemented |
| Unauthorized access | Low | High | ✅ Role-based access implemented |
| Data loss | Low | High | ✅ Versioning + lifecycle policies |
| Compliance violation | Low | Critical | ✅ Major requirements met |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | ✅ Multipart upload implemented |

### Quality Gate Decision (Updated)
