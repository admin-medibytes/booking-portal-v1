# Story: 404 Page Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user (both logged in and anonymous),  
**I want** to see a helpful 404 error page when accessing a non-existent route,  
**so that** I understand the page doesn't exist and can easily navigate back to valid areas of the application

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **404 page displays for all non-existent routes** - Any undefined route in the application should render the 404 page component
2. **Clear error messaging** - Page displays a clear "Page Not Found" or "404" message that's immediately understandable
3. **Navigation options provided** - Include at least a "Go to Home" button/link for easy navigation back to the application
4. **Responsive design** - 404 page must be fully responsive and match the application's design system
5. **Authentication-aware content** - If user is logged in, show user-specific navigation options (e.g., "Go to Dashboard"); if not logged in, show public navigation options
6. **Consistent styling** - Page uses the existing application theme, colors, and components
7. **SEO compliance** - Page returns proper 404 HTTP status code for search engines
8. **Quick loading** - Page should load instantly without unnecessary API calls or heavy assets

  - [x] Return consistent JSON error format
  - [x] Test with API client tools

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Authentication**: Better-Auth library (check `@/lib/auth` for auth client)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui`
- **Current Routes**: Check `/app` directory for existing route structure

### Key Implementation Files
- **Create**: `/app/not-found.tsx` (Next.js convention for 404 pages)
- **Reference**: `/components/ui/button.tsx` for navigation buttons
- **Auth Hook**: Use auth context from existing implementation
- **Layout**: May need to use root layout or create minimal layout

### Critical Implementation Notes

**1. Next.js 404 Convention:**
- The `not-found.tsx` file in `/app` directory automatically handles 404s
- This file is automatically used when `notFound()` is called or route doesn't exist
- Must be a React Server Component by default unless you add 'use client'

**2. Authentication Check Pattern:**
```typescript
// Expected pattern based on better-auth
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth'
const session = await auth() // for server component
// OR for client component:
// const { user } = useAuth()
```

**3. Existing Design Patterns:**
- Check if there's a `PageContainer` or similar wrapper component
- Look for existing error pages for consistent styling
- Navigation components likely in `/components/navigation` or similar

**4. Route Protection Consideration:**
- Based on risk analysis, implement consistent 404 for all non-existent routes
- Don't leak information about protected route existence
- Consider logging 404s on protected route patterns for security monitoring

**5. Required Imports (likely needed):**
```typescript
import Link from 'next/link'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Home, ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react' // if using icons
```

**6. Performance Considerations:**
- Keep the component lightweight - no heavy dependencies
- Avoid unnecessary API calls
- Static rendering preferred where possible

### Important Edge Cases to Handle
1. **Dynamic Routes**: Ensure dynamic route files call `notFound()` for invalid params
2. **API Routes**: Separate JSON 404 response for `/api/*` routes
3. **Middleware**: Check `/middleware.ts` doesn't interfere with 404 routing
4. **Auth Loading**: Handle the loading state to prevent navigation flicker

### Identified Risks and Mitigations

**Dynamic Route Conflicts:**
- Risk: Dynamic routes might catch invalid paths before 404
- Mitigation: Add validation in all dynamic routes with `notFound()` calls

**Authentication State Race Conditions:**
- Risk: 404 page might show wrong navigation during auth loading
- Mitigation: Implement loading skeleton or server-side auth check

**Middleware Interference:**
- Risk: Auth middleware might redirect instead of showing 404
- Mitigation: Add explicit bypass rules in middleware.ts

**API Route 404s:**
- Risk: API 404s might return HTML instead of JSON
- Mitigation: Create separate API catch-all route handler

**Protected Route Information Disclosure:**
- Risk: Different 404 behavior might reveal protected route existence
- Mitigation: Consistent 404 response regardless of route protection status
