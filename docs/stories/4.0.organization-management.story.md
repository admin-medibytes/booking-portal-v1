# Story 4.0: Organization Management - Create & Manage Organizations

## Status
Done

## Story

4. Organization list table shows all organizations with key details, team count, and member count
5. Search and filter capabilities: by name, status (active/inactive)
6. Organization detail view showing teams, members count, and audit history
7. Edit organization details with validation
8. Delete organizations (handled by Better Auth with proper cleanup)
9. Team management within organization: create, edit, delete teams
10. Form validation: unique organization slug, required fields

## Dev Notes

### Better Auth Integration

**Organization Plugin Configuration**:
```typescript
// auth.ts
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

organization({
  // Enable teams feature
  teams: {
    enabled: true,
    maximumTeams: 10,
    allowRemovingAllTeams: false
  },
  // Custom metadata for our business fields
  schema: {
    organization: {
      additionalFields: {
        contactEmail: {
          type: "string",
          input: true,
          required: false
        },
        address: {
          type: "string", // JSON stringified address object
          input: true,
          required: false
        },
        phone: {
          type: "string",
          input: true,
          required: false
        }
      }
    }
  },
  // Hooks for audit logging
  organizationCreation: {
    beforeCreate: async ({ organization, user }) => {
      // Add default metadata
      return {
        data: {
          ...organization,
          metadata: {
            ...organization.metadata,
            createdBy: user.id
          }
        }
      }
    },
    afterCreate: async ({ organization, member, user }) => {
      // Log to audit service
      await auditService.log('organization.created', {
        organizationId: organization.id,
        userId: user.id
      })
    }
  },
  organizationDeletion: {
    beforeDelete: async ({ organization }) => {
      // Check for active members/resources
    },
    afterDelete: async ({ organization }) => {
      // Audit log deletion
    }
  },
  // Admin-only restrictions
  allowUserToCreateOrganization: async (user) => {
    return user.role === 'admin'
  }
})
```

**Organization Metadata Structure**:
```typescript
interface OrganizationMetadata {
  contactEmail?: string;
  phone?: string;
  address?: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    zipCode: string;
    country: string;
  };
}
```

### API Wrapper Pattern

**Admin Organization Service**:
```typescript
class AdminOrganizationService {
  async createOrganization(data: CreateOrgDto) {
    // Use Better Auth's organization.create
    const org = await auth.api.createOrganization({
      body: {
        name: data.name,
        slug: data.slug,
        logo: data.logo,
        contactEmail: data.contactEmail,
        phone: data.phone,
        address: JSON.stringify(data.address)
      }
    })
    
    // Create default team
    await auth.api.createTeam({
      body: {
        name: "Default Team",
        organizationId: org.id
      }
    })
    
    return org
  }

  async listOrganizations(filters: OrgFilters) {
    // Get all orgs using Better Auth
    const orgs = await auth.api.listOrganizations()
    
    // Apply custom filtering for status, search, etc
    return orgs.filter(org => {
      if (filters.search && !org.name.includes(filters.search)) return false
      if (filters.status && org.metadata?.isActive !== (filters.status === 'active')) return false
      return true
    })
  }

  async getOrganizationWithStats(orgId: string) {
    // Use Better Auth's getFullOrganization
    const fullOrg = await auth.api.getFullOrganization({
      query: { organizationId: orgId }
    })
    
    // Get teams
    const teams = await auth.api.listTeams({
      query: { organizationId: orgId }
    })
    
    return {
      ...fullOrg,
      teamCount: teams.length,
      memberCount: fullOrg.members.length
    }
  }
}

```

### Component Architecture

```
/app/admin/organizations/
├── page.tsx                         # Main list page
├── [id]/
│   └── page.tsx                    # Detail/edit page
├── components/
│   ├── CreateOrganizationDialog.tsx # Creation form modal
│   ├── OrganizationListTable.tsx   # Main table component
│   ├── OrganizationFilters.tsx     # Filter controls
│   ├── TeamManagement.tsx          # Team CRUD component
│   └── TeamDialog.tsx              # Team create/edit modal
```

### Client-Side Integration

```typescript
// Using Better Auth client
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

// Check slug availability
const isAvailable = await authClient.organization.checkSlug({
  slug: "my-org-slug"
})

// Create organization (admin wrapper)
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/organizations', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Medical Clinic",
    slug: "medical-clinic",
    contactEmail: "contact@clinic.com",
    phone: "+1234567890",
    address: { /* ... */ }
  })
})

// List user's organizations
const { data: organizations } = authClient.useListOrganizations()

// Get full organization details
const fullOrg = await authClient.organization.getFullOrganization({
  organizationId: "org-id"
})

// Team management
await authClient.organization.createTeam({
  name: "Emergency Department",
  organizationId: "org-id"
})
```

### Validation Rules

1. **Name**: Required, 2-100 characters
2. **Slug**: Required, unique (validated via Better Auth's checkSlug)
3. **Type**: Required, must be one of: clinic, law_firm, insurance
4. **Email**: Optional, valid email format if provided
5. **Phone**: Optional, valid phone format if provided
6. **Address**: Optional, all subfields required if address is provided
7. **Team Name**: Required, unique within organization

### Business Logic

**Organization Creation**:
- Only admins can create organizations (enforced by Better Auth config)
- Default team created automatically
- Audit logged via afterCreate hook
- Metadata stores business-specific fields

**Organization Deletion**:
- Better Auth handles member cleanup
- Invitations are canceled automatically
- Teams are deleted
- Audit logged via afterDelete hook

**Team Management**:
- Maximum 10 teams per organization (configurable)
- Cannot delete last team (allowRemovingAllTeams: false)
- Team members tracked separately from organization members

### Security Considerations

1. Only system admins can manage organizations (enforced via Better Auth hooks)
2. Audit log all organization/team modifications via Better Auth hooks
3. Validate all input data (slug uniqueness via Better Auth)
4. Better Auth prevents deletion of organizations with active members
5. Rate limiting handled at API gateway level

### Testing

**Unit Tests**:
- `/tests/unit/services/organization.service.test.ts`
- `/tests/unit/components/admin/organizations/*.test.tsx`

**Integration Tests**:
- `/tests/integration/api/admin/organizations.test.ts`
- `/tests/integration/flows/organization-creation.test.ts`

**E2E Tests**:
- Organization creation flow
- Team management operations
- Search and filter functionality
- Status toggle operations
