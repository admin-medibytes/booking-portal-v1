## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Better Auth is fully configured with all required plugins in /src/lib/auth.ts
- Auth middleware created in /src/server/middleware/auth.middleware.ts with role checking
- Email service placeholder exists at /src/server/services/email.service.ts - needs AWS SES integration
- Environment variables for auth already configured in /src/lib/env.ts
- Database schema includes Better Auth tables (users, sessions, organizations, invitations)
- Session management configured with secure cookies and optional Redis storage

### Authentication Configuration
**Better Auth Admin Plugin**:
- Admin user creation endpoint: `POST /api/auth/admin/create-user` [Source: better-auth/plugin-admin.md#creating-users]
- Required fields: email, password, name
- Optional: role assignment, custom user data
- Example implementation in /src/lib/auth.ts with admin() plugin

**Organization Invitation Flow**:
- Invitations sent via `organization.inviteMember()` [Source: better-auth/plugin-organization.md#inviting-a-user]
- Requires implementing `sendInvitationEmail` function in auth config
- Invitation acceptance via `acceptInvitation()` with invitation ID
- Can configure email verification requirement before acceptance
- Prevents duplicate invitations automatically

**Email OTP Configuration**:
- Already configured in auth.ts with emailOTP() plugin
- Supports password reset via 'forget-password' type [Source: better-auth/plugin-email-otp.md#types]
- OTP length: 6 digits, expiration: 300 seconds
- Requires implementing `sendVerificationOTP` function

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login page with form
- `/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` - Password reset flow
- `/src/app/(auth)/verify/page.tsx` - Email/invitation verification
- `/src/server/routes/admin.routes.ts` - Admin API routes
- `/src/server/services/user.service.ts` - User management logic
- `/src/components/auth/` - Auth-related components
  - `login-form.tsx` - Login form component
  - `password-reset-form.tsx` - Password reset form
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#application-structure]

### API Endpoints
**Admin User Management** (to be created):
- POST /api/admin/users - Create user with role
- GET /api/admin/users - List users with pagination
- POST /api/admin/users/:id/resend-invitation - Resend invitation
- DELETE /api/admin/users/:id - Remove user (soft delete)

**Authentication Routes** (handled by Better Auth):
- POST /api/auth/sign-in/email - Email/password login
- POST /api/auth/sign-out - Logout
- POST /api/auth/email-otp/send-verification-otp - Send OTP for password reset
- POST /api/auth/email-otp/verify-otp - Verify OTP and reset password
- GET /api/auth/organization/get-invitation - Get invitation details
- POST /api/auth/organization/accept-invitation - Accept organization invitation
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#authentication-routes]

### User Roles and Permissions
Organization roles configured in Story 1.3:
- `admin`: Full system access, can create users and impersonate
- `user`: Base role for all authenticated users
- Organization-specific roles:
  - `owner`: Full organization access
  - `manager`: Team management access
  - `team_lead`: Team-level permissions
  - `referrer`: Can create bookings
  - `specialist`: Can view assigned bookings
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-roles]

### Form Validation
Use TanStack Form with ArkType validation:
```typescript
// Login form validation
const loginSchema = type({
  email: "string.email",
  password: "string.min(8)",
  rememberMe: "boolean | undefined"
});

// User creation validation
const createUserSchema = type({
  email: "string.email",
  name: "string.trim.min(2)",
  role: "'admin' | 'user'",
  organizationId: "string",
  teamId: "string | undefined"
});
```
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#validation]

### Security Considerations
**Session Management**:
- "Remember Me" functionality via Better Auth session.expiresIn option
- Default session: 7 days, extended session: 30 days
- Secure cookies in production with httpOnly flag
- CSRF protection built into Better Auth

**Password Requirements**:
- Minimum 8 characters (configurable)
- Should include complexity requirements in UI
- Secure reset tokens with 1-hour expiration
- Rate limiting on password reset requests

**Invitation Security**:
- Time-limited invitation links (7 days default)
- One-time use tokens
- Audit log all invitation actions
- Validate organization membership before activation
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#security]

### Email Templates
Create React Email templates for:
1. User invitation email
2. Password reset email

Templates should include:
- Organization branding
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Expiration time warnings
- Support contact information
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#aws-ses]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests**:
- Test login form validation and submission
- Test password reset form validation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **excellent code quality** with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and strong TypeScript typing. The developer has successfully implemented 6.5 out of 7 acceptance criteria with production-ready code that follows architectural patterns and security best practices. The use of Better Auth plugins is well-integrated, and the test coverage is comprehensive.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: /src/server/services/user.service.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed line 302 - changed `createdAt: invitations.expiresAt` to `createdAt: invitations.createdAt`
  - **Why**: This was a clear copy-paste error that would have caused incorrect timestamp display in invitation listings
  - **How**: Now invitation listings will show the correct creation timestamp instead of expiration timestamp

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows established patterns with clean architecture
- Project Structure: ✓ All files placed in correct locations per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests implemented
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC5 partially complete (90%), missing navigation menu adaptation
