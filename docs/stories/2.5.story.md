# Story 2.5: Booking Detail Page & Status Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to view complete booking details and update the booking status,  
**so that** I can track the examination progress accurately.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Detail page shows all booking information: specialist, examinee, date/time, status, progress
2. Status section shows current status (Active/Closed/Archived) with last update timestamp
3. Progress tracker displays current stage with user-attributed history
4. Authorized users can update progress stages (scheduled → rescheduled/cancelled/no-show → generating-report → report-generated → payment-received)
5. Status changes create audit log entries with user and timestamp
6. Related documents section shows uploaded files (prepare for Epic 3)
7. Booking modification requires appropriate role permissions
8. Mobile-responsive layout maintains usability on all devices

### Data Models
**Booking Model with Relations**:
```typescript
interface Booking {
  id: string;
  examDate: Date;
  patientFirstName: string;
  patientLastName: string;
  patientPhone: string;
  patientEmail: string | null;
  appointmentType: 'in_person' | 'telehealth';
  status: 'active' | 'closed' | 'archived';
  currentProgress: 'scheduled' | 'rescheduled' | 'cancelled' | 'no_show' | 
                  'generating_report' | 'report_generated' | 'payment_received';
  notes: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  // Relations
  specialist: Specialist;
  progress: BookingProgress[];
  documents: Document[];
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#booking]

**BookingProgress Model**:
```typescript
interface BookingProgress {
  id: string;
  bookingId: string;
  progress: string; // One of the valid progress states
  changedById: string; // User who made the change
  changedForId: string | null; // If via impersonation
  notes: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#bookingprogress]

### API Specifications
**Booking Detail Endpoint**:
- `GET /api/bookings/{bookingId}` - Fetch complete booking details
- Returns booking with specialist, progress history, and documents
- Filtered by organization membership
- 404 if booking not found or not authorized

**Progress Update Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/bookings/{bookingId}/progress`
- Request body:
  ```typescript
  {
    progress: 'scheduled' | 'rescheduled' | etc...,
    notes?: string
  }
  ```
- Validates state transitions
- Creates BookingProgress record
- Updates booking.currentProgress
- Returns updated booking with new progress
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#booking-endpoints]

### Component Specifications
**Progress State Transitions**:
```typescript
const validTransitions = {
  scheduled: ['rescheduled', 'cancelled', 'no_show', 'generating_report'],
  rescheduled: ['cancelled', 'no_show', 'generating_report'],
  cancelled: [], // Terminal state
  no_show: [], // Terminal state
  generating_report: ['report_generated'],
  report_generated: ['payment_received'],
  payment_received: [] // Terminal state
};
```
[Source: Extracted from architecture context]

**Authorization Pattern**:
- Use Better Auth session from middleware
- Check user.organizationId matches booking.organizationId
- Specialists: booking.specialistId must match user.id
- Admins: Full access within organization
- Regular users: Read-only access
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authorization]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/app/(dashboard)/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - Detail page
- `/src/components/bookings/booking-detail-card.tsx` - Basic info display
- `/src/components/bookings/booking-progress-tracker.tsx` - Progress timeline
- `/src/components/bookings/booking-progress-update.tsx` - Update form
- `/src/components/bookings/documents-section.tsx` - Documents placeholder
- `/src/hooks/use-booking.ts` - Hook for fetching single booking
- `/src/hooks/use-update-progress.ts` - Mutation hook for progress updates
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure]

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with Better Auth for user context
- All state changes require audit log entries
- Progress updates must validate state transitions
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching and mutations
- Implement optimistic updates with proper rollback
- Mobile responsiveness is mandatory
- Role-based permissions must be enforced
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Audit Logging Requirements
**Required Audit Fields**:
```typescript
{
  userId: string, // From Better Auth session
  impersonatedUserId?: string, // If applicable
  action: 'booking.progress.updated',
  resourceType: 'booking',
  resourceId: string, // Booking ID
  metadata: {
    previousProgress: string,
    newProgress: string,
    notes?: string
  },
  ipAddress: string, // From request headers
  userAgent: string, // From request headers
  timestamp: Date
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#auditlog]

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Progress tracker should use timeline/stepper visualization
- Color-code progress states consistently with status badges
- Show relative timestamps (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Confirmation dialogs for irreversible state changes
- Clear error messages for invalid transitions
- Loading states during mutations

4. **State Management**: Proper use of TanStack Query with cache invalidation
5. **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple validation layers
6. **UX**: Smooth interactions with loading states and optimistic updates

**Minor Observations:**
1. Progress stage mappings are hardcoded (acceptable for MVP)
2. Document upload is placeholder only (by design for Epic 3)
3. No real-time updates for multi-user scenarios (future enhancement)

### Test Design Recommendations

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
1. **Authorization Tests**: Verify each role's access permissions
2. **State Transition Tests**: Validate all allowed/blocked transitions
3. **Audit Logging Tests**: Ensure all changes are logged correctly
4. **Error Handling Tests**: Test network failures, invalid data
5. **Mobile Responsiveness Tests**: Verify layouts on various devices

**Performance Test Scenarios:**
1. Load booking with large progress history
2. Concurrent progress updates
3. Cache invalidation timing

### Technical Debt Assessment
**Current Debt: Minimal**
- No significant technical debt identified
- Code follows established patterns
- Proper error handling throughout

### Recommendations
1. **Future Enhancement**: Consider WebSocket for real-time multi-user updates
2. **Monitoring**: Add performance metrics for progress update operations
3. **Documentation**: Consider adding JSDoc comments for complex authorization logic
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite when testing phase begins

### Compliance Summary
✅ All 8 acceptance criteria fully met
