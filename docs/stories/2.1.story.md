## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Authentication and role-based access control fully implemented with Better Auth
- Booking model already exists with acuityAppointmentId field for synchronization
- API route structure established at /src/server/routes/
- Service layer pattern in use at /src/server/services/
- Repository pattern implemented at /src/server/repositories/

### Data Models
**Specialist Model**:
```typescript
interface Specialist {
  id: string;
  userId: string;           // Link to Better Auth user account
  acuityCalendarId: string; // Acuity calendar identifier
  name: string;
  specialty: string;
  location: string | null;  // null for telehealth-only specialists
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE specialists (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  acuity_calendar_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  specialty VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255), -- NULL for telehealth-only
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  INDEX idx_specialists_acuity_calendar (acuity_calendar_id)
);
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#specialists]

**Webhook Events Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'acuity',
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  resource_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- Acuity appointment ID
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  error TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Specifications
**Acuity API Configuration**:
- Base URL: https://acuityscheduling.com/api/v1
- Authentication: HTTP Basic Auth with User ID and API Key
- Rate Limits: 10 requests per second, 5000 requests per hour
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#acuity-scheduling-api]

**Key Acuity Endpoints**:
- `GET /availability/times?appointmentTypeID={id}&calendarID={id}&date={date}` - Fetch available time slots
- `GET /calendars` - List available calendars/specialists
- `GET /appointmentTypes` - List appointment types (services offered)
- `POST /appointments` - Create new appointment booking
- `PUT /appointments/{id}` - Update existing appointment
- `DELETE /appointments/{id}` - Cancel appointment
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#acuity-scheduling-api]

**Webhook Endpoint Specification**:
```yaml
/webhooks/acuity:
  post:
    summary: Receive Acuity webhook events
    security: []  # No auth, uses signature validation
    parameters:
      - name: X-Acuity-Signature
        in: header
        required: true
```
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md#webhooks-routes]

### Component Specifications
**Acuity Integration Service**:
- Responsibility: Manages all interactions with Acuity Scheduling API
- Key Interfaces:
  * Appointment creation/update/cancellation
  * Availability fetching with caching
  * Calendar synchronization
  * Webhook event processing
  * Specialist calendar mapping
[Source: architecture/components.md#acuity-integration-service]

**Cache Service Requirements**:
- Technology: Redis 7.2
- Availability cache TTL: 5 minutes
- Appointment types cache TTL: 1 hour
- Session storage also uses Redis
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#cache]

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- `/src/server/services/acuity.service.ts` - Acuity API client service
- `/src/server/repositories/specialist.repository.ts` - Specialist data access
- `/src/server/routes/specialists.routes.ts` - Specialist management endpoints
- `/src/server/routes/webhooks.routes.ts` - Webhook handling endpoints
- `/src/server/db/schema.ts` - Add specialists and webhook_events tables
- `/src/lib/redis.ts` - Redis client configuration
- `/src/types/acuity.ts` - Acuity API response types
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-code]

### Technical Constraints
- Must use ArkType for validation (100x faster than Zod)
- API calls must go through service layer, never direct HTTP calls
- Environment variables accessed only through validated env object
- All API routes must use standard error handler middleware
- Follow established repository/service/route pattern
- Maintain proper TypeScript types for all Acuity responses
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Integration Best Practices
- Cache availability responses in Redis to avoid rate limits
- Always include timezone in date/time requests
- Store Acuity appointment ID for all bookings for synchronization
- Handle API downtime gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- Validate webhook signatures for security

**Backend Service Test Example**:
```typescript
// tests/unit/services/acuity.service.test.ts
describe('AcuityService', () => {
  it('handles API rate limits gracefully', () => {
    // Test rate limiting logic
  });
  
  it('caches availability responses correctly', () => {
    // Test Redis caching with 5-minute TTL
  });
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural patterns with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and security-conscious design. The Acuity integration follows repository/service patterns consistently. However, the complete absence of tests (0% coverage) represents a critical gap that prevents validation of the implementation's correctness.

Key strengths:
- Well-structured code following established patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Strong security implementation (webhook signature validation, timing attack prevention)
- Proper use of TypeScript types and ArkType validation
- Efficient caching strategy with Redis

Critical gaps:
- No test implementation (0% coverage)
- Missing rate limiting on webhook endpoint (DoS vulnerability)
- No circuit breaker pattern despite requirements
- Cache stampede protection not implemented

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - code quality is good but needs testing before any modifications.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows all critical rules (ArkType validation, service layer, env access)
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization and naming conventions
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No tests implemented despite comprehensive test plan
- All ACs Met: ✓ All functionality implemented per requirements

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement all planned unit tests for services and repositories
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement webhook security tests
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add rate limiting to webhook endpoint to prevent DoS
- [ ] **HIGH**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for Acuity API resilience
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add distributed locking for cache refresh to prevent stampedes
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] **LOW**: Consider extracting webhook validation to reusable middleware

### Security Review

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. Webhook endpoint lacks rate limiting - vulnerable to DoS attacks
2. No security tests to validate signature verification logic

**Strengths:**
- Excellent webhook signature validation with timing-safe comparison
- Proper authentication on all specialist endpoints
- Role-based access control with field-level filtering
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Redis caching with appropriate TTLs (5 min for availability, 1 hour for appointment types)
- Rate limiting logic for Acuity API calls
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No protection against cache stampede when multiple requests hit expired cache
- Missing circuit breaker could lead to cascading failures during Acuity downtime

### Files Modified During Review

None - pending test implementation before any modifications.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/2.1-acuity-integration-specialist-configuration.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250817.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20250817.md

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above
(Story owner decides final status)

**Rationale**: While the implementation is complete and follows good practices, the absence of any tests (0% coverage) and critical security vulnerability (missing webhook rate limiting) necessitate a FAIL gate. These issues must be addressed before production deployment.
