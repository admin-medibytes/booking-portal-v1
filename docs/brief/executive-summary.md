# Executive Summary

**Medical Examination Booking Platform** is a HIPAA-compliant and Privacy Act 1988/Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) compliant web application that streamlines the Independent Medical Examination (IME) referral process for Australian legal firms. The platform addresses the regulatory requirement where law firms cannot directly engage medical specialists for IMEs, instead having to work through approved intermediary services that coordinate these examinations.

**Primary Problem:** In Australia's personal injury legal system, law firms are required to use intermediary services to book Independent Medical Examinations with specialists. This creates inefficiencies through manual phone-based coordination, limited visibility into booking status, and dependency on third-party scheduling systems that weren't designed for the specific needs of legal-medical examination workflows.

**Target Market:** Australian law firms handling personal injury and workers' compensation cases, IME coordination services acting as intermediaries, medical specialists conducting independent examinations, and administrative staff managing the examination workflow.

**Key Value Proposition:** A purpose-built platform that digitizes the IME booking process, reducing coordination time by 80%, ensuring HIPAA and Privacy Act 1988/APPs compliance for sensitive medical-legal documents, providing real-time visibility across all stakeholders, and streamlining report generation by enabling specialists to dictate findings while admins handle report writing.
