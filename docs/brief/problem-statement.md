# Problem Statement

**Current State:** Law firms requiring Independent Medical Examinations must work through intermediary coordination services, creating a multi-layered, inefficient process. Referrers (lawyers) currently call administrative staff who manually create bookings on their behalf using disparate systems. This results in:

- **Time Inefficiency:** Each booking requires 15-20 minutes of phone coordination between lawyers and admins
- **Limited Visibility:** Referrers have no real-time access to booking status, requiring follow-up calls for updates
- **Document Fragmentation:** Medical-legal documents are scattered across email, fax, and various third-party systems
- **Scheduling Complexity:** Coordinating between lawyer availability, specialist schedules, and examinee needs through manual methods
- **Compliance Risks:** Handling sensitive PHI through non-secure channels like email poses HIPAA/Privacy Act 1988/APPs violations

**Impact Quantification:**
- With 50+ active referrers and ~90 bookings/month, the current system wastes approximately 27 hours of staff time monthly on booking coordination alone
- Missed appointments and rescheduling issues occur in 15% of cases due to communication gaps
- Document retrieval for completed examinations takes an average of 30 minutes per case
- Administrative burden prevents scaling beyond current volume without proportional staff increases

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- **Generic scheduling tools** (like Calendly) lack the multi-party coordination required for IMEs
- **Medical appointment systems** don't account for legal documentation requirements and chain of custody
- **Current dependency on Acuity** provides basic scheduling but lacks integrated document management, role-based access, and examination workflow tracking
- **Email/phone coordination** creates no audit trail for compliance and offers no systematic workflow

**Urgency:** As the business grows and regulatory scrutiny on medical-legal documentation increases, the manual process becomes unsustainable. The platform must launch within 6 weeks to handle increasing case volume and maintain competitive advantage in the IME coordination market.
